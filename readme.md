#### Practice building multiple html files and adjust them with css elements, June 2020_

#### By Chris Vp and help with partner Jeffry F, classmate
## Description

Within this directory or repo, I have multiple html files that are all linked to one css file, styles.css.  within styles. css I added many syling elements to adjust presentation of data in each of my files. In this lesson, I learned how modifying a div class can be easier than individually modifying p lines.  I also learned about columns, box models, floats and sidebars

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* feel free to explore the html files and styles.css file I created
* Open each file either in a text editor to modify content or in a browser to view the beautiful simplicity of my coding experience
